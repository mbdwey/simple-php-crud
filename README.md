# simple-php-crud
I d this example as a task requested from me to evaluate me as PHP developer.

-----
- Login page by username , password  , remember password
- Make a web page to add-edit-delete categories - sub-categories(unlimited sub categories as tree ) & products inside any level in cat or sub-cat
- Each product has name and image
- All of these in one page using PHP without framework

-----
I will Not expose company name to prevent faking the test.

Now I use the same task to evaluate others.
